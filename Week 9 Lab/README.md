## Lab Questions

## Summary
	In this lab we started by creating the Vivado project and importing the provided files.  
	We then started with developing the logic for the multiplexer file. After this we wrote  
	the logic for the demultiplexer and the top.v file. After this we generated the bitstream  
	and programed the code to the Basys3 board.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
	A multiplexer allows for the user to select a certain output with a certain combination  
	of inputs.
### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
	A demultiplexer allows for the user to get the inputs used to receive a  
	specific output.
### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
	These circuits with knowledge of Shannon's law can be used to recreate  
	any logic function.
